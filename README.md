# Horiseon homepage

This is a webpage for Heriseon, a social solution services incorporation

## Description

The code given for Horiseon doesn't follow HTML semantics as well as having some redundant sections. I will use refactoring to put the code into correct HTML semantics and keep the same formatting of the existing code. There are also a few alt tags which were added after the images in an attempt to give the website a higher SEO. Fixed a problem with the link for "search engine optimization" to help the user move around the website. 

## tasks completed

1. Changed the HTML to follow general HTML semantics. 

        **example:** <div class="#"> changed to <section class="#">
        **example:** <div id="#"> changed to <article id="#">
2. Cleaned up CSS selector elements that had redundant sections.

        **example:** <header class="header"> changed to <header>
3. Added alt tags after the images within the main section of the website for accessibility.     
4. Fixed the header attributes so that they were in sequential order. 

        **example:** in the footer section there was a h2 tag and it was changed to and h4 tag.
