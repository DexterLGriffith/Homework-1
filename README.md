# Horiseon Homepage

This is a webpage for Heriseon, a social solution services incorporation

## Description

The code given for Horiseon doesn't follow HTML semantics as well as having some redundant sections. I will use refactoring to put the code into correct HTML semantics and keep the same formatting of the existing code. There are also a few alt tags which were added after the images in an attempt to give the website a higher SEO. Fixed a problem with the link for "search engine optimization" to help the user move around the website. 

## Tasks Completed

1. Changed the HTML to follow general HTML semantics. 

        **example:** <div class="#"> changed to <section class="#">
        **example:** <div id="#"> changed to <article id="#">
2. Cleaned up CSS selector elements that had redundant sections.

        **example:** <header class="header"> changed to <header>
3. Added alt tags after the images within the main section of the website for accessibility.     
4. Fixed the header attributes so that they were in sequential order. 

        **example:** in the footer section there was a h2 tag and it was changed to and h4 tag. 
5. Changed the title from "website" to "Horiseon Homepage"
6. Fixed the link for "Search Engine Optimization" that wasn't working. 
7. Made sure elements had good flow and logical position.
