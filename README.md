# Horiseon homepage

This is a webpage for Heriseon, a social solution services incorporation

## Description

The code given for Horiseon doesn't follow HTML semantics as well as having some redundant sections. I will use refactoring to put the code into correct HTML semantics and keep the same formatting of the existing code. There are also a few alt tags which were added after the images in an attempt to give the website a higher SEO. Fixed a problem with the link for "search engine optimization" to help the user move around the website. 

## tasks completed

    1. Changed the HTML to follow general HTML semantics. 
        **example:** <div class="#"> changed to <section class="#">
        **example:** <div id="#"> changed to <article id="#">
    2.
